## Scripts

### Uploader Enhancements
Provides various enhancements to the workflow of uploading torrents to RPDL.

### F95Zone Masked Skipper
Mirror of the ultra version of https://github.com/Cat-Ling/f95zone-skipper/, allows for fast skipping of the masked page when opening select file hosts' links.

## Installation:
1. Install a userscript manager (extension allowing modifying of webpages or behavior). [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php) is recommended.
    - With the uploader-enhancements script, there is currently an issue with [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) and [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) causing button injection to break.
2. Paste the script you want to use in a [new script](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=en#Q102).
3. Read each script's README for more info.
