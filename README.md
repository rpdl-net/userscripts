# RPDL-related userscripts
This repository contains various scripts that can be of use to uploaders and users alike within the RPDL ecosystem.

## Scripts
### [Uploader Enhancements](https://github.com/rpdl-net/userscripts/tree/main/uploader-enhancements)
Provides various enhancements to uploaders' workflow in uploading content to RPDL.

### [F95 Skipper](https://github.com/rpdl-net/userscripts/tree/main/f95-skipper)
Fork (more a mirror if anything) of [Cat-Ling/f95zone-skipper]. Provides 2 scripts automating skipping the "Link Masked" page when following select file hosts' links.

## Installation:
1. Install a userscript manager (extension allowing modifying of webpages or behavior). [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php) is recommended.
    - With the uploader-enhancements script, there is currently an issue with [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) and [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) causing button injection to break.
2. Paste the script you want to use in a [new script](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=en#Q102). If you set-up your userscript manager correctly, upon opening the scripts' `[..].js` file, the manager should prompt you for install.
3. Read each script's README for more info.
