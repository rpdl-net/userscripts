# RPDL-related userscripts
This repository contains various scripts that can be of use to uploaders and users alike within the RPDL and/or F95 ecosystem.

## Scripts

> [!NOTE]
> _**Scripts with a :star: can be used by anyone without issues, while those without will require specific access for the script to be fully functional.**_

### [F95 Skipper](https://github.com/rpdl-net/userscripts/tree/main/f95-skipper) :star:
Fork of [Cat-Ling/f95zone-skipper](https://github.com/Cat-Ling/f95zone-skipper/). Provides scripts to skipsthe "Link Masked" page for F95 file host redirects.

### [Uploader Enhancements](https://github.com/rpdl-net/userscripts/tree/main/uploader-enhancements)
Provides various enhancements to RPDL uploading workflow.


## Installation:
1. Install a userscript manager (extension allowing modifying of webpages or behavior). [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php) is recommended.
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > For the uploader-enhancements script, there is a bug with [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) causing button injection to break.
  > [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) is at this time, untested. 
2. Paste the script you want to use in a [new script](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=en#Q102). If you set-up your userscript manager correctly, upon opening the scripts' raw `[..].js` file, the manager should prompt you for install.
3. Read each script's README for more info.
