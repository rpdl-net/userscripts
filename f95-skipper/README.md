## F95 Skipper

Fork (more a mirror if anything) of [Cat-Ling/f95zone-skipper](https://github.com/Cat-Ling/f95zone-skipper/). Provides 2 scripts automating skipping the "Link Masked" page when following select file hosts' links.

Any feedback or issues concerning these scripts will be looked at by us, but will likely be forwarded to them.

### Installation:
1. Install a userscript manager (extension allowing modifying of webpages or behavior). [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php) is recommended.
2. Paste the contents of [f95-skipper-base.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpdl-net/userscripts/refs/heads/main/f95-skipper/f95-skipper-base.js) or [f95-skipper-ultra.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpdl-net/userscripts/refs/heads/main/f95-skipper/f95-skipper-ultra.js) in a [new script](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=en#Q102).
    - Base version will auto-click the "Continue to.." prompt.
    - Ultra version (currently in Beta) will do the same thing as the base version, but quicker (almost immediately).

### Additional notes _(from original repo)_:
These scripts are provided as-is, and are not officially endorsed or supported by F95.

As of 26 January 2024, the scripts are in compliance with F95's terms of service and general rules.
