## F95 masked link skipper userscript

These two scripts are forks (if we're being honest, more mirrors than anything) of Cat-Ling's [f95zone-skipper](https://github.com/Cat-Ling/f95zone-skipper). Any feedback or issues concerning these scripts will likely be forwarded to them.

### Installation:
1. Install a userscript manager (extension allowing modifying of webpages or behavior). [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php) is recommended.
2. Paste the contents of [f95-skipper-base.js](link) or (f95-skipper-ultra.js)(link) in a [new script](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=en#Q102).
    - Base version will auto-click the "Continue to.." prompt
    - Ultra version (currently in Beta) will do the same thing, but quicker (almost immediately)

### Additional notes (from the original repo):
These scripts are provided as-is, and are not officially endorsed or supported by F95.

As of 26 January 2024, the scripts are in compliance with F95's terms of service and general rules.
